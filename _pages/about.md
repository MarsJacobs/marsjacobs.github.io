I am first year Ph.D. student in the Artificial Intelligence Hardware & Algorithm lab at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng). I am fortunate to be advised by professor [Jungwook Choi](https://jchoi-hyu.github.io/). My research interest lies in the area of **LLM Quantization** with Knowledge Distillation and **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**.
