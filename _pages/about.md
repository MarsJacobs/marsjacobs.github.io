Hi! I am Minsoo Kim, I'm currently in my third year of the integrated Ph.D. program in the Artificial Intelligence Hardware & Algorithm lab at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng). I am fortunate to be advised by professor [Jungwook Choi](https://jchoi-hyu.github.io/). Recently, I was honored to be selected as a winner in the [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship Korea 2023](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2023-south-korea).

My core research focuses on understanding the effects of Quantization in language models across diverse NLP tasks. Using these insights, I've actively applied **Knowledge Distillation** in **Quantization Aware Training (QAT)** to enhance the robust performance of quantized language models, aimed for efficient inference.

Currently, my research interest lies in the area of **LLM Fine-Tuning with Quantization** with memory efficient Knowledge Distillation. Not limited to Quantization, I also hold a deep interest in techniques for fine-tuning smaller LLMs to unleash the potential of **specialized LLMs**, in the direction of democratizing LLMs for broader accessibility.
